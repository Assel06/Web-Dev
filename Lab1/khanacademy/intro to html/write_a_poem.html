    <h1> Life is tough, so you are </h1>
    <p> In the crucible of life, you stand so tall, <br>
A resilient spirit, weathering it all. <br>
Through trials and troubles, you persevere, <br>
In the face of adversity, there's no room for fear.<br>

Life is tough, a tempest so wild,<br>
Yet within you, strength is compiled.<br>
A warrior's heart, beating strong,<br>
In the symphony of struggle, you belong.<br>

Each challenge faced, a lesson learned, <br>
In the pages of resilience, your story is earned. <br>
Through storms and shadows, you find your way, <br>
A beacon of hope in the darkest day. <br>

Life may be tough, a relentless climb, <br>
But within your spirit, there's a sublime <br>
Ability to rise, to endure and thrive, <br>
For in your essence, true strength lies. <br>

So stand unyielding, in the face of strife,<br>
For within you, resides the spark of life.<br>
Embrace the journey, fierce and true,<br>
In the toughness of life, you find the real you.<br> </p>
